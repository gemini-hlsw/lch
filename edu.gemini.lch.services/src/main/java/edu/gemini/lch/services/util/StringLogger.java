 * A logger that can be used to collect log messages.

 * to it with level Info or higher. This utility can be used to get a copy of the log messages that are
 * created during the processing of emails etc. This seemed to be the simpler approach than writing to log files
 * in parallel (the "normal" log file and a special log that can be sent to users as part of the emails).
 * IMPORTANT: The assumption is that the class we attach to is executed only once at a time, otherwise we will end
 * up with a mixture of log messages from different instances of the class running! This is currently the case, but
 * if this ever changes, something a bit more elaborate is needed.
